    <h1>SPACE</h1>
    <h2>Space travel began in 1957 with the launch of the first satellite, called Sputnik, by the former Soviet Union. Many satellites and probes are launched into space. This is done to observe the Earth, collect data on climate and weather, supply modern navigation systems, explore distant celestial bodies and perform scientific research related to space. Yuri Gagarin became the first human being to fly to space on 12th April 1961.</h2>
