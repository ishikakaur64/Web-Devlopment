        <h1>Table Tennis</h1>
        <p>My favorite hobby is playing table tennis.Table tennis, also known as Ping Pong, is a fun sport played on a flat table. Two or four players use small paddles to hit a lightweight ball back and forth over a net. It's a fast game that requires quick thinking and good hand-eye coordination. It's a great way to get exercise and have fun. 
Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,with event categories in both men's and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
 Playing table tennis provides both physical and mental health benefits.</p>
